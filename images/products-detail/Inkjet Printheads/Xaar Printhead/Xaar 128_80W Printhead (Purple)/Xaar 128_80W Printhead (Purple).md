Description:
The Xaar Irix Core 80W printhead with purple insulator. For years the Xaar 128 set the industry standard by offering a consistent, simple and highly flexible inkjet solution for a variety of applications across the coding & marking and wide-format graphics industries. TheXaar 128 printheadis available in two drop volume variants (40 pL and 80 pL) and is compatible with a range of UV, solvent and oil-based inks.
This printhead serves as a direct replacement for the discontinued Xaar XP12800005 and XP12800006 heads, and can be used instead of XP12800071, offering identical performance, quality and printer compatibility. No firmware changes are required in the printer software either.
The ink connections on the Xaar 128 and Xaar Irix are 3.1 mm in diameter, therefore the recommendation for the tubing is for 3mm ID tubing. The exact choice of tubing would depend upon the inks you are using.
