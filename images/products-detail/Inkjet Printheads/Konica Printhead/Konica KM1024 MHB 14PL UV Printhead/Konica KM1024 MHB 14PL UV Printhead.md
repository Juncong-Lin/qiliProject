Konica KM1024 MHB 14PL UVPrinthead
Konica KM1024 MHB 14PL UV Printhead is a robust, shear mode, piezo on-demandPrint Headthat is usable in both binary and 8 level greyscale mode, providing variable drop size and higher print quality without the use of additional print heads. Konica KM1024 MHB 14PL UV Printhead is a vast improvement over the KM512 print head series, offering twice the print width and double the level of greyscale. Konica Minolta piezo on-demand inkjet heads are driven using lower voltages than other inkjet heads and the new actuator used in the KM1024 reduces power consumption even further. The Konica KM1024MHB/14PL UV Printhead has 1024 nozzles with a droplet size of 14 pl and a native resolution of 360 dpi. The print head has an integrated heater, which makes it ideal for UV inks, but suitable for solvent inks as well. This is Konica original print head and it includes the Head ID and the necessary waveform information.
