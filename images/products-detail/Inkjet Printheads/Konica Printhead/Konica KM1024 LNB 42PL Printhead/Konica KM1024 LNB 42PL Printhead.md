ThisPrint Headis a robust, shear mode, piezo on-demand print head that is usable in both binary and 8 level greyscale mode, providing variable drop size and higher print quality without the use of additional print heads. It is a vast improvement over the KM512 print head series, offering twice the print width and double the level of greyscale.
