Ricoh GH2220Printhead
Features:
Expanding industrial opportunities with new precision fabricated silicon range.
The GHPrint Headis a result of over 10 years of Ricoh research and manufacturing optimization and is now made available for OEMs to incorporate in their aqueous andSolvent Inkbased printer offerings.

Supports water and solvent based inks.
In addition to water-based inks, these print heads support solvent inks as well.
