AMO Solvent Inkjet Printer AM3208K24 i 3.2meters with 8 Konica 1024i Printhead
1. Printhead Heating System & Ink Circulation: The Printhead plate integrates a heating function to ensure optimal ink flow stability across varying temperature environments. The built-in ink
circulation system prevents pigment sedimentation within the printhead, effectively reducing nozzle clogging risks.
2. Fully Transparent Secondary Ink Tank Design & Independent Color Pressure Control:(1) Transparent construction enables easier troubleshooting and reduces maintenance time. (2) Independent pressure adjustment mechanisms optimize ink consumption efficiency.
3. Single Motorized Pressure Roller System & Silent Guide Rails/Sliders:(1) Allows real-time adjustment of individual pressure rollers during printing operations to eliminate material wrinkling without interrupting production, minimizing material waste. (2)High-speed silent guide rails ensure smoother printhead movement, enhancing printing precision while reducing operational noise. This design minimizes mechanical wear and extends guide rail lifespan.
4. Adjustable Vacuum Platform & Roller Speed Modulation:(1) Enables manual airflow adjustment during printing to resolve material feeding issues caused by excessive vacuum, ensuring smooth feeding of materials with varying thicknesses.(2) The roller power regulation system enhances compatibility with diverse material types for both feeding and collection operations.
5. High-Power Heating/Drying System: Features segmented heating zones to improve material ink absorption and color fastness. Incorporates a proprietary built-in thermal air circulation chamber coupled with a cold air diversion system, enabling rapid post-drying cooling to ensure finer details and glossier finishes.
