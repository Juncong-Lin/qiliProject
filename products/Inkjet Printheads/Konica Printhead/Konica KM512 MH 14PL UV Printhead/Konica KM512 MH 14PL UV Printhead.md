Shear mode, Piezo On-Demand Print Head
Piezo on-demand inkjet ejects ink drops utilizing deformation of small ink chambers composed of piezoelectric material, by applying electric field in accordance with signals. The principle of shear mode piezo actuation with shared wall structure allows lower power consumption as well as a high-density nozzle array.

512 Nozzle with 360 dpi resolution
High resolution, 360 nozzle per inch spacing has enabled arranging 512 Nozzle on a comactly designed print head. The KM512 series consists of type L, M and S, corresponding to unit drop volume capabilities of 42pl, 14pl and 4pl respectively. The type M and S can be driven in 4 level grey-scale mode for reproducing high quality images with smoother tones.

Compatible with Solvent, UV, Oil.
Due to its specially designed internal structure, the KM512 series boasts a wide range of ink compatibility, including aggressive solvent inks typically used for super-wide format printers. Inks which have high viscosity at room temperature, such as UV ink, can be heated up to 55 degrees Celsius with the H type's internal heater.

Enabling Comapct Design of Head MountSystem
This series is specially designed to have a "wing" structure so that users can precisely align the print heads without difficulty. This feature allows easy combination of page-width printhead units for the purpose of single-pass high-speed printing. The same external design allows interchangability of different type heads on the same mount system
