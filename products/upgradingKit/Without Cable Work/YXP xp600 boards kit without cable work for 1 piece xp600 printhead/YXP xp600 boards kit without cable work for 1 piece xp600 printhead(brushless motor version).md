Comment:
This is a boards kit with cables typically for upgrading a Chinese old inkjet printer with new system and new print head. For example this kit could upgrade a eco-solvent of witcolor,micolor,gongzheng,allwin,galaxy(sid triton) which original with DX5 printhead into new printer with xp600  printhead, or this kit could upgrade a solvent inkjet printers like infiniti with seiko spt510 to a new system with xp600 printhead. No matter it is a eco-solvent or solvent printer,this kit could work for it as long as it is a roll-to-roll system in media handling . And this kit work for brushless motor.
