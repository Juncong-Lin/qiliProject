Comment:
This is a boards kit with cables typically for upgrading a Chinese old inkjet printer with new system and new print head. Typically this kit is for upgrading a old Chinese uv flatbed printer, no matter what head it originally equipped, into a new uv flatbed printer with 2 R800 printhead. It also could upgrade any of this flatbed printer into a normal eco-solvent flatbed printer (no uv style)
