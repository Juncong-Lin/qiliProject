# AMO-AL100 HIGHSPEED FLAT ALUMINUME BENDING MACHINE

Price: Not available

Product Details:

Fast, continuous and stable operation, and the materia thickness adaptive No adjustment is required to change at any time, No marks on the material surface.
Flapping bending, its bending and forming degree is better than extruded arc bending The software has been carefully adjusted and tested, so its bending speed is better than the extruded arc bending According to the actual processing conditions, the software can be used in three bending modes to create more value.
Each groove is only one knife,high work efficiency,Slotting depth adjustable, easy to use Carbide blade, no loss.
At the same time in the processing of the natural deformation of aluminum coil, straightening treatment, especially suitable for aluminum side band, super word production and processing, so that the shape profile excellent presentation.
Bending axis is equipped with servo system,Rapid speed, high precision
